Awesome spider!!!

## 0x01 

Before `spider` you should install some packages in your system or run my script:
```Shell
$ git clone https://github.com/i0Ek3/Sp1der
$ cd Sp1der
$ sudo ./pkgInstall.sh
```
And this script support Unix system(Linux or Mac OS), yes, I hate Windwos!! 

In other hand, you should install `chromedriver` and `geckodriver` for your browsers(like Chrome or Firefox), also you want to install `PhantomJS`, a non-GUI, programmable WebKit browser.

Charles also need, please install it by your own way.

By the way, this project based Python 3.7.
